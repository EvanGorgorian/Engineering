            <br>
            Over the past week we as a class have learned so much due to the teaching of Mr. Poole. We have learned the engineering process, which has shown us the proper steps which seemed a bit basic and dull but once it got to the parts most of us didn't know it started to get me excited of all the things we didn't know about engineering. But one of my favorite things we did this week was when we had to guide a marble into a cup from around 30 feet because it allowed us as a class to build our teamwork skill and was generally one of the funnest thing we

            <br>
            This week we had learned about he main ideas of engineering discipline including always clean up after yourself, not to mess with others, and all the saftey prcedures. The project that was assigned to us was to make a design of our Rube Goldberg machine. I have started designing a Rube Goldberg machine with my fellow companions in a attempt to pop the balloon by starting a draph of the product we would like to create. The challenge tha twas assigned to us was to make a electronic device replica in a website called Tinkercad.

            This week has been confusing to say te least with the confusing schedule and weird class times. In the past week I have learned how to properly use Tinkercad and all the possible tests that can be done. My groups RubeGoldberg machine will start with a baseball and end with a needle popping a balloon using the machines: wheel and axle, wedge, and lever. I think the most challenging part will be the construction of the machine.

            <br>
            This week we tested many times because the dominoes were to light but we did find a solution after testing. Our device given more time could have been better made by having more complex systems rather than having a simple design. I worked with my teamates by contributing ideas and helping shape the project.

            9-28-23 This is my fifth journal entry
            This week I have learned about different components of a computer. The type of engineering that interests me the most is dissect and reassembling computers. This week the main things we have focused on are dissect computers and electronics. I learned this week about computers and how they work are how the components are each individualy doing something to keep the computer working. This weekend I am going to relax and do HW.

            This week we have learned about bioengineering adn how it is able to benefit our lives and broaden our horizons for around the world. So our hand was able to pickup an empty water bottle while only using one hand by pushing the hand forward it tighten strings and closes the fingers. With our hand I would use different materials to tighten the strings so it is consistantly working. For this weekend I have homecoming and a basketball game to go to along with mountais of homework.
