        This week I learned about chemical engineering and how it is used, studied, and how its important. We practiced some basic chemical engineering by making ooblek with cornstarch and water, we observed it as well like how it melts when left alone and hardens when copressed. We learned about the fields you could work in and what exactly you'd do. Along with the aspects of

        This week was an eventful week we had started with a base model of our mousetrap car on tinkerkad tp get an idea on how it's supposed to roll the farthest. So far I believe that our car is going well we have the base idea of it and all we are continuing to imporve it we have decided to make the rod and the point from the wheels to the mousetrap the same length, although it has less power it is more efficient and we believe that tradeoff is worth it. Next week I plan to finish my tinkercad and start preparing the materials for the build that I will start hopefully around Wednsday or Thursday.

        Last week I finsihed my tinkerkad around tuesday and for the rest of the week I had started to work on my car and maneged to complete the wheels, body, and axles for the cars. My goal this week is to finish my car and be able to test and make modifications to it next week. This weekend I spent it with my grandma watching thr gramnys.

        This week I fisnished my first car and had extra time to start my second car, the base model has been done but there is still lots of work to do. I have to make a longer string and reduce the resistent inbetween the wheels and the straw holding it.
